# Repository Overview

> Auto-generated by Laravel Generator Command

## Purpose

This application generates `.llm.md` documentation files that summarize a Laravel project’s tech stack, structure, routes, and features for large language models. It is primarily intended for developers working with Laravel codebases who want to give LLMs better context about their projects. It solves the problem of manually preparing structured, high-level project context so LLMs can provide more accurate and informed assistance.

## Tech Stack

Laravel 12, PHP 8.2
